Avolites Titan One and T1 can't use MIDI controllers. But they can receive sACN signal from outside. <br>
So we can change MIDI signal to sACN signal to use MIDI controllers with them. This is what<br>
 <a href="https://github.com/cbdevnet/midimonster"  target="_blank">MIDI Monster</a> does. 
Converting MIDI signal to sACN signal. You push a MIDI button or move <br>
a MIDI fader, it make a MIDI signal. MIDI Monster takes the MIDI signal, converts it to sACN signal<br>
and give it to Avolites Titan one and T1. <br><br>
With this way, you can use MIDI controllers with Avolites Titan One and T1.<br>
Even more, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laovVcEkHGc&ab_channel=YLP" target="_blank">with SBC</a> you can use MIDI Monster with all of the Avolites consoles.<br>
It's the one of same working way of Avolites consoles communicates. Using sACN protocol.
